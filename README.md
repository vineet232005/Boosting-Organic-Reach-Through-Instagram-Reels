## 📌 Project Objective
To analyze the performance of Instagram Reels and identify strategies to increase organic reach and engagement among the student/tech audience.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
How can we effectively use Instagram Reels to boost visibility and engagement without relying on paid promotions?

## ✅ Solution Approach
- Created a 1-week content calendar with diverse content types (tutorials, memes, motivational).
- Posted or simulated the posting of 5 Reels.
- Tracked the following engagement metrics:
  - Reach
  - Likes
  - Comments
  - Shares
  - Saves
  - Engagement Rate = (Likes + Comments + Shares + Saves) / Reach
- Compared results with competitor Reels in a similar niche.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Instagram (Mobile App)** – Reels posting and analytics tracking  
- **Google Sheets** – Engagement data tracking and calculations  
- **Canva** – Reel visuals and thumbnails  
- **Native Instagram Analytics** – Post-level performance metrics  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Tutorial Reels had the highest number of saves.
- Meme-style Reels received more shares and likes.
- Reels under 30 seconds performed significantly better.
- Captions with emojis and calls to action (CTAs) saw higher interaction.

## 💡 Recommendations
- Focus on short, high-value Reels (~30 seconds)
- Use trending sounds and hashtags strategically
- Post consistently, preferably during peak hours (evenings)
- Ask questions in captions to boost comments

## 📈 Outcome
An analytics-based strategy for optimizing Instagram Reels to enhance organic growth, supported by measurable insights and performance comparisons.
